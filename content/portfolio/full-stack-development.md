I designed and developed the Bluemax Holidays  website using HTML, CSS and Javacript which was slightly modified to meet their needs. The website is static and blazing fast hosted freely on Cludflare pages served through CDN. Soon the website will be adapted for Hugo static CMS and will be mobile friendly.
